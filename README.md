- Movie-matched animated background per page: popcorn, orbs, speed lines, bubbles and dragon embers.
- Event cards on the home page. Click one and it expands into the full round details with a register button, or open its own page.
- Poster block in the hero, schedule, prize podium and an "Admit One" ticket with a live countdown to **29 Oct 2026, 09:00 IST**.
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. No build step, plain HTML/CSS/JS (fonts are self-hosted).
